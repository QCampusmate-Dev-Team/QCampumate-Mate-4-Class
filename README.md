## QCampusmate Mate for Class
This extension aims to enhance UX around `Course Results/成績照会` page on Kyushu University Campusmate site: 
- With a more compact UI layout, it reduces unnecessary mouse movement. 
- Its Campusmate counterpart loads slow and frows upon frequent opertions. This extention improves this significantly by extracting the transcript data from the document in question and saving to the browser's local storage once off.
- It includes all features available on `Course Results/成績照会` page, and, additionally, enables the users to sort/filter based on grade, year and course category etc.
- It shows units remaining to graduate by calculating the currently earned units againt degree requirements.


p.s.
*The developer is currently considering adding an academic plan interface that  enables freshman/sophomore students to conveniently formulate plans on taking courses throughout their undergraduate career.*
